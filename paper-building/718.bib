     abstract = {The neoclassical growth model accords with empirical evidence on convergence if capital is viewed broadly to include human investments, so that diminishing returns to capital set in slowly, and if differences in government policies or other variables create substantial differences in steady-state positions. However, open-economy versions of the theory predict higher rates of convergence than those observed empirically. We show that the open-economy model conforms with the evidence if an economy can borrow to finance only a portion of its capital, for example, if human capital must be financed by domestic savings.},

     abstract = {This paper develops asymptotic distribution theory for single-equation instrumental variables regression when the partial correlations between the instruments and the endogenous variables are weak, here modeled as local to zero. Asymptotic representations are provided for various statistics, including two-stage least squares (TSLS) and limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators, Wald statistics, and statistics testing overidentification and endogeneity. The asymptotic distributions are found to provide good approximations to sampling distributions with 10-20 observations per instrument. The theory suggests concrete guidelines for applied work, including using nonstandard methods for construction of confidence regions. These results are used to interpret Angrist and Krueger's (1991) estimates of the returns to education: whereas TSLS estimates with many instruments approach the OLS estimate of 6%, the more reliable LIML estimates with fewer instruments fall between 8% and 10%, with a typical 95% confidence interval of (5%, 15%).},

doi = {10.1215/00182702-2009-030}, 
abstract ={This paper discusses the history of the use of cross-country regressions in modern growth economics. These regressions continue to be the workhorse of empirical growth analysis even though their meaning continues to be controversial. I argue that the early interpretations of these regressions have proven to be inappropriate and led to substantial exaggeration of the evidentiary support for various new growth theories. On the other hand, I argue that these regressions have a valuable role to play in identifying the modern analog of stylized facts for growth behavior.},
