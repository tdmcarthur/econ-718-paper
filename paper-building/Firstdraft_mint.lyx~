\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation and Literature review 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we will review some theoretical models depicting the relationsh
ip between trade and wage inequality, as well as some empirical evidences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's first go back to the basic Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) trade model with two
 countries (the North and the South) and two goods (high-skilled and low-skilled
-intensive goods).
 The North (
\emph on
the South
\emph default
) has relatively large supply of high-skill labor (
\emph on
low-skilled labor
\emph default
) and thus has comparative advantage in high-skilled- (
\emph on
low-skill
\emph default
ed-) intensive goods.
 We can think of the North as developed countries and the South as developing
 counterparts.
 When trade opens, cost of producing each good become the same across countries.
 Assuming zero trade costs (transportation, tariffs, etc.--also known as
 ice-berg costs), price of goods become the same across countries.
 Under comparative advantage framework, the North (
\emph on
the South
\emph default
) will export high-skilled- (
\emph on
low-skill
\emph default
ed-) intensive goods.
 For the South, relative price of low-skilled intensive good will rise.
 By Stolper-Samuelson theorem

status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Stolper and Samuelson theorem describes that the return to the intensively-used
 factor will increase if the relative price of the good increases.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

, this will raise the South's demand for low-skilled labor and their relative
 wage.
 Therefore, HO model implies that in the developing countries, trade should
 result in lower wage inequality which can be measured by 
\emph on
wage premium
\emph default
 (the ratio of wage between high-skilled and low-skilled labors).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This prediction of the HO theory applies the case of the East Asian tigers
 where trade liberalization was followed by a period of decreasing inequality.
 During the 1960s to the 1970s, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan
 went through export-oriented industrialization.
 Wood (1994) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Wood94"

\end_inset

 finds that for these economies, wage premium went down at a faster rate
 after the liberalization comparing to other periods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, these evidences are not consistent with the experiences of
 Latin America and some other Asian countries.
 Some studies find that trade reform in Latin American countries during
 the mid 1980s has resulted in higher wage premium (Hanson and Harrison
 (1999) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Hanson99"

\end_inset

, Beyer, Rojas and Vergara (1999)

\end_inset

).
 They find that trade exposes low-skill intensive industry to competition
 from other countries with large supply of low-skilled labor.
 This drives down the relative price of low-skilled-intensive goods and
 hence reducing relative wage for low-skilled labor.
 Hasan and Jandoc (2010) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Hasan2010"

\end_inset

 studies the relationship using data from the Philippines during the second
 half of the 1990s.
 They find that trade induces an employment shifts from exposed sectors
 to more protected sectors (especially service sector).
 In these sectors , wage premium tends to be higher, resulting in higher
 overall wage premium.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why would some countries experience reduction in wage premium following
 trade liberalization while others experience increasing gap? Wood (1997)
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand nocite
key "Wood97"

\end_inset

explains that the contrasting experience of East Asia (1960-70s) and Latin
 America (mid-1980s to 1990s) stems from differing world market environment
 in the two periods.
 He argues that by mid-1980s, China has emerged as an important player in
 the world economy.
 Moreover, in the latter period, the world has shifted toward using skill-comple
mentary technology.
 These two factors are significant cause affecting the role of trade liberalizat
ion on wage inequality in Latin America (Wood, 1997).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A formalized model by Dornbusch, Fischer and Samuelson (1980) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand nocite
key "Dornbusch80"

\end_inset

explains how trade leads to higher wage inequality.
 This model is based on the HO trade model with two countries, and a continuum
 of goods (rather than two goods).
 Goods are ranked by level of skill needed in the production technology.
 Under trade, prices of goods and wages equalize across countries.
 On average, the North (
\emph on
the South
\emph default
) will export high-skilled- (
\emph on
low-skill
\emph default
ed-) intensive goods.
 Now suppose there is a positive shock in the world demand for high-skilled-inte
nsive goods.
 This decreases relative wage of low-skilled labor, and thus increases wage
 premium in the South.
 Second, suppose there is a positive shock in the South's supply of low-skilled
 labor.
 This decreases relative price of low-skilled labor.
 The South faces higher wage premium.
 The results above are under the case of incomplete specialization.
 If the two countries differ significantly, we might have the case of complete
 specialization.
 In this case, the South exports goods ranged from the lower end of the
 skill-intensity rank up to a cutoff point.
 The North exports goods starting from the cutoff point up to the higher
 end of the skill-intensity rank.
 This allows us to consider the case of technological catch-up of developing
 countries.
 With an improvement of production technology in the South, the country
 can export goods in the higher skill-intensity range, raising the cutoff
 point.
 This increases relative wage of high-skilled labor.
 The South faces higher wage premium.
 Zhu and Trefler (2005) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

finds empirical evidence supporting how technological catch-up under trade
 increase wage inequality in developing countries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Up to this point, it seems like Heckscher-Ohlin's prediction only held in
 the earlier wave of trade liberalization in East Asia but not after that.
 So, trade is bad for wage equality after all? The answer might be no, according
 to Atolia (2007).

Atolia (2007)

constructed a model explaining how the effect of trade on wage inequality
 changes over time.
 Assume there are three sectors in the economy: non-traded (e.g.
 construction), export and import-competing sectors.
 Export sector produces low-skilled-intensive goods while import-competing
 sector produces high-skilled-intensive goods.
 Inputs in this model compose of capital good, imported intermediate good
 (i.e.
 machineries) and labor (low-skilled and high-skilled).
 Capital good is produced using intermediate good and non-traded good.
 It is mobile but subjected to adjustment costs.
 Under free trade, lowered tariffs on intermediate good reduces the cost
 of capital accumulation, while tariff reduction in final goods expose import-co
mpeting sector to foreign competition.
 This implies that export sector will suddenly increase rate of capital
 accumulation due to cheaper price of capital.
 On the other hand, import-competing sector will contract and it will have
 to decumulate its capital stock.
 This transition will be slow as tcapital good is not freely mobile.
 Trade liberalization will lead to 
\emph on
asymmetric capital accumulation;
\emph default
 Export sector suddenly increases its capital accumulation while import-competin
g sector gradually decumulate its capital stock.
 Now, export sector will increase its demand for high-skilled labor to match
 the new level of capital goods (assuming capital is skill-complementary).
 This will increase relative wage of high-skilled labor and wage premium
 in the short run.
 In the long run, the economy will reach the new steady state.
 The adverse effect of trade on wage inequality is temporary.
 An important caveat lie in the assumption that developing countries acquire
 all its intermediate goods from abroad.
 Even though this is a strong assumption, there are some supporting evidences.
