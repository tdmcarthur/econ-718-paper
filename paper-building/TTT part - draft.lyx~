___Endogeneity in the Wage-Capital equation____
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We should be concerned about simultaneous causation in equation #<>.
 Modeling only one side of the supply-demand relationship is a well-known
 pitfall in econometrics.
 However, the relationship between capital stock and the wage premium is
 indirect: it operates through the complementarity of capital and high-skilled
 labor.
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to model the relationship as a full supply-dem
and simultanous equation system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will still take an instrumental variable approach.
 A straightforward instrument for the level of capital stock is 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, the price of capital accumulation.
 In a closed economy, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is determined endogenously; firms' solutions to their profit maximization
 problems should ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\nicefrac{\partial F}{\partial K}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 represents the aggregate production function.
 In an open economy, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 can be determined exogenously.
 The import price of capital goods determines the domestic capital price
 in the Atolia model.
 Clearly we want to avoid assuming aspects to the Atolia model while we
 test it, however.
 We can rely on other models in which international financial markets can
 exogenously determine 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

<citation?>.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is determined in other countries rather than endogenously.
 In principle, this could lead to all countries facing the same 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, which would present a statistical identification problem.
 We observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is not equalized across countries, though, so we can proceed <make citation
 of a paper dealing with this.
 Also, this challenges a bit our assertion that r is exogenously determined>.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the firm's optimization problem, if an exogenous shock to 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{\partial F}{\partial K}<r$
\end_inset

, then capital should be accumulated faster.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{\partial F}{\partial K}>r$
\end_inset

, then the capital stock should shrink.
 This leads to the following functional relationship: 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{\partial K}{\partial t}=G\left(r\right)$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the change of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 over time is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Our RHS variable in equation #<> is in levels of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, not change, so we must integrate both sides with respect to time: 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\intop_{a}^{b}G\left(r\right)dt$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(r\right)$
\end_inset

 is simply linear, then we can approximate this relationship by simply summing
 over the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in each time period: 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\sum_{t=a}^{b}r_{t}+\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 For an IV strategy, we need the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 affects the wage premium only through its effect on capital accumulation.
 <TODO: justify a little>.
 The first stage of the model can then be expressed as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\vartriangle\ln K_{it}=\alpha''+\beta_{r}\vartriangle\ln\left(\sum_{t=a}^{b}r_{t}\right)+\vartriangle\xi_{it}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and the second stage is just the original equation that we wanted to estimate:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\vartriangle\ln\dfrac{w_{H\, it}}{w_{L\, it}}=\alpha'+\beta_{K}\vartriangle\ln K_{it}+\vartriangle v_{it}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for each country and year is available from the Penn World Table.
 We will divide the price of investment by the price of consumption to obtain
 the real investment price.
 We choose the years 1975-1990 for the first period measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{t=a}^{b}r_{t}$
\end_inset

 and 1991-2004 for the second period, which matches the periods of measurement
 for capital stock growth in the tariff-capital equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fatal flaw in the approach outlined above is that 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 turns out to be an extremely weak instrument for capital accumulation.
 The F-statistic for a regression of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vartriangle\ln K_{it}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\vartriangle\ln\left(\sum_{t=a}^{b}r_{t}\right)$
\end_inset

 is 0.20.
 In light of the rule of thumb that an instrument is weak if the F-stat
 is less than ten, this instrument appears to be useless.
 <Staiger and Stock (1997) http://www.econ.brown.edu/fac/Frank_Kleibergen/ec266/sta
igerstock1997.pdf> Therefore, we have to discard this approach.
 If we cannot detect an effect of the price of investment on capital accumulatio
n, then it seems no other variable would be powerful enough to act as a
 strong instrument, so here we abandon our efforts to handle endogeneity
 in the wage-capital equation.
 As consolation, the weakness of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 as an instrument for capital accumulation provides indirect evidence that
 the effect of the wage premium upon capital accumulation may be weak.
 That is to say, if the price of capital accumulation itself does not detectably
 affect capital accumulation, the price of another factor of production
 probably does not affect it either.
 Hence, the problem of endogeneity that spurred this exercise may not be
 worrisome.
 In any case, the results

___Results__

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<say that throughout, our precision is limited by sample size>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among developing countries, the correlation between changes in capital and
 consumption tariffs is 0.89.
 Thus, regressing capital accumulation against both variables (and their
 product) would inflate the variance of the estimated coefficients.
 Any effect may be masked by this variance inflation.
 Therefore, we will start by presenting a parsimonous specification that
 only includes the product of the two tariffs, which is our main coefficient
 of interest.
 Table 1 displays these results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that many coefficients are not different from zero, the table shows
 t-statistics rather than standard errors so it is easier to assess the
 distance from statistical significance.
 Among developing countries, we detect no effect of the capital and consumption
 tariff cross term on the rate of capital accumulation, although the sign
 of the point estimate is consistent with the theory.
 The level of capital stock, however, does have an effect on the wage premium
 that is different from zero at the 5% level.
 We have estimated that a one percent rise in the per capita capital stock
 leads to a 0.3% rise in the ratio of high-skill wages to low-skill wages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also include an estimation of the same model with both developed and
 developing countries.
 Interaction terms separate the effects on the two groups.
 For the Atolia theory to be true, we need the effect to exist for developing
 countries, but not for developed countries.
 The results are consistent with the theory.
 The effect of the product of capital and consumption tariffs for developing
 countries is not statistically different from zero, but the estimated sign
 is negative, consistent with theory.
 Furthermore, the point estimate for developed countries is positive but
 not statistically significant.
 If these effects were statistically significant, we might conclude that
 the Atolia mechanism holds for developing countries but not developed countries.
 Finally, the results indicate that the positive effect of capital stock
 on the wage premium holds only for developing countries.
